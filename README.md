Quick note to those reading: several hours after I sent this in, I suddenly realized that there was a bug in the slideshow JavaScript, which I then corrected (a quick change to line 56 of application.js) While my total time spent working on the site is still only about five hours, the time by the clock between beginning and end is over the time limit. If you like, feel free to evaluate the older version of the site that does not have this fix.
